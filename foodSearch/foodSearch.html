<!-- 

only show title, when clicked open modal pop up with side corner check box 


when modal is closed a shopping cart with the number of items is shown 
when modal is open the nutrient info is chosen 
modal can be opened in shopping cart but position is moved to right

user is then shown a box where it says calculate insulin 
when user hasnt put a logged dose, user is prompted to log a doze 
then if user logged dose && selected calciulate insulin it shows logged insulin taken 

also save in local storage previous meals 
user also has option to save the meal to saved meals 



today rewrite code and no more vibe coding 






- for saving food push data into an array and fetch i think when user save 
- for remove, remove form that array 
- similar to editing 


- for history a separate array i think idk


problem 
- i wnat the inpiut to only show values in desc first value in the array 
- how? definetly before re-rendering idk
- forget for loop and functions , lets try to use filtering 
-rewrite the divInfo function






current[array] = [with lowercase];
const firstWord = current.filter(getFirstValue);

function checkAdult() {
  //check if it equals the inputValue 
}
